# About

This is a template project set up for building a multiplayer Unity game using the Photon networking framework. This project comes with a menu that handles connecting to the server, creating and joining rooms, and basic instantiation and control of players.

# Licensing

This project uses the [Modern UI Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-150824) available on the Unity Asset Store

Using this pack is not required, but you will need to replace the buttons with basic Unity ones if you do not own the Modern UI Pack.
